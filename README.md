# Quantitative Finance Projects

Welcome to my personal repository of quantitative finance projects. Iâ€™m currently in the final year of my DPhil in **Theoretical Physics** at the **University of Oxford**, and I am actively exploring **quantitative research** as a career path. This collection of projects reflects my passion for mathematical modeling, simulation, and machine learning in the context of financial markets.

## ðŸ“¬ About Me

I'm currently finishing my DPhil in **Theoretical Physics** at the **University of Oxford**. My academic work focuses on stochastic processes and mathematical modeling of complex systems, which naturally extend into my growing interest in **quantitative finance** â€” especially in the areas of **derivatives modeling, machine learning**, and **systematic strategies**.

Feel free to explore the projects, and don't hesitate to reach out with any constructive feedback.
